# LLM vs Traditional ML for Sentiment Analysis

## Research Motivation
This project explores the tradeoffs between traditional machine learning models and large language models (LLMs) for sentiment classification.

## Objective
To compare:
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- GPT-based LLM

## Evaluation Criteria
- Accuracy
- Speed
- Cost-efficiency

## Key Insight
Traditional ML models are fast and cost-efficient, while LLMs provide better generalization and language understanding.

## Tech Stack
Python, Scikit-learn, OpenAI API

## Future Work
- Larger datasets
- More evaluation metrics
- Bias analysis
